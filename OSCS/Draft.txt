It can be done with ffmpeg; I've done it myself. That said, it is technically complex. That said, again, it is what any other software you might use is going to do in its core essence.

The process works like this:

Demux audio from source 1 to raw wav
Demux audio from source 2
Demux audio from source 3
Demux video from source 1 to MPEG1
Demux video from source 2
Demux video from source 3
Concatenate audio 1 + audio 2 + audio 3
Concatenate video 1 + video 2 + video 3
Mux audio 123 and video 123 into target
encode to target format
